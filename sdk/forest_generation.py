'''
SPARK v1.0 --> Generating grid-based forests for cellular-automata wildfire simulation backend

Spark is a software package built and distributed by Ignite Labs developed by Jack Ceroni and Abdullah Hadi

---------------------------------------------------------------

At the moment, grids and composite grids must be rectangular,
but support for irregularly shaped grids/composite grids will be
introduced in the next version of Spark

---------------------------------------------------------------

sparklib.CreateFixedGrid('width', 'length', 'coordinate_file')
--> Creates a grid with fixed tree coordinates (read from a file)
sparklib.CreateRandomGrid('width', 'length', 'tree_density')
--> Creates a grid with randomly placed trees, but with a fixed tree density (unless the 'random') keyword is passed
sparklib.CreateClusterGrid('width', 'length', 'meanclustersize', 'frac_allowed' 'tree_density')
--> Creates a grid of trees with patches that clustered close together (NEW FEATURE)
sparklib.CreateEvenGrid('width', 'length', 'probradius', 'tree_density')
--> Creates a grid that distributes trees very evenly and tries to avoid clusters
sparklib.CreateCompositeGrid('width', 'length', arg1.coordinate('top_left'), ..., argn.coordinate('top_left'))
--> Creates a grid that involved a mixture of different grid types (previously defined methods)

---------------------------------------------------------------

Output of all functions should be an array with coordinates [ [ [0, 0], 0], [ [0, 1], 1 ], ..., [ [n, n], 0 ] ]
Given [[0, 0], 0], the two values in the first bracket represents the coordinates of the tree (x, y), the third
value can take on the numbers 0, 1, or 2.
0 indicates no tree in the given coordinate, 1 indicates that a tree exists in that coordinate, and 2 indicates
 that there was a tree in that coordinate but it was burned down after an iteration of the simulation
